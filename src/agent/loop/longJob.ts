/**
 * Host-driven paging of a long job.
 *
 * A long job is the turn's pending model parts that name papers to read or
 * write. While the papers it has left fit one pass, the host leaves it alone,
 * as it leaves every turn. When they do not, the host works through them a
 * page at a time: it names a page, and when every paper of the page is
 * settled (done or excepted by every part that names it), the runtime digests
 * the page's reads into per-paper results and the host names the next page,
 * until no paper is left; then it says the job is complete.
 *
 * How deep a job reads follows its parts' declared effects, never the
 * request's words. Reading depth: a paper an open part reads, writes an
 * artifact from, or writes a note or an annotation on is read, sized by the
 * page share. Metadata depth: a paper the job only files, tags or edits is
 * decided from its title, authors and abstract. A paper both kinds name is
 * read: the reading part sets its price and its page's message. A paper a
 * digest part has done was read by the host already: no part reads it
 * again, and a note on it is written from its digest.
 *
 * In estimated prompt tokens:
 * - B, the input budget left after the answer's output reserve;
 * - P, the prompt as it stands;
 * - c, what one paper costs: the prompt's growth per paper settled since the
 *   host first saw the job, once any paper has settled, so a job of changes
 *   measures its own calls; before that, the mean prior of the papers left.
 *   A restart the runtime makes within a page (a provider replay or a prompt
 *   over budget, a step of too many calls) drops part of that growth: the
 *   runtime says so (`restarted`), the papers settled before it stay out of
 *   c, and the growth is measured again from the prompt the restart left. A
 *   prompt found under the one the measurement started from is taken alike.
 *   Only a paper whose text some open part needs (a read part, an artifact
 *   written from it, a note or an annotation written on it) is priced by its
 *   text hint (`priorCost`); a paper the job only changes otherwise (files,
 *   tags, edits its record) is priced at its record.
 * The papers left fit one pass while they cost no more than B − P − c (one
 * paper of slack for the estimate).
 *
 * A page is the first K papers not yet settled, in frozen order, with
 * K = max(1, min(fit bound, cost bound)). Nothing else bounds a page.
 *
 * The fit bound, ⌊(B − P) / c⌋ − 1, is what the room holds with one paper of
 * slack. A page ends early when some of its papers have settled and those it
 * has left no longer fit: left × c > B − P − c.
 *
 * The cost bound keeps the job's input tokens least. Each model request sends
 * the whole prompt: what its page started from and the page's reads so far.
 * A page boundary itself costs no request: the host ends a page after the
 * round that settles it, and the next request already starts the next page.
 * Take
 * - R, the prompt a page starts from, the P it is planned with: after a page
 *   ends, the restarted prompt as measured (its checkpoint and every digest
 *   so far) plus the job's message;
 * - m, the papers one request reads: the mean over the requests that left
 *   papers of their page unread, the model's own batch. A request that read
 *   all its page still had was held back by the page, so while every
 *   request has been, m is taken as twice the most papers one of them read:
 *   pages double until the model shows its batch;
 * - o, the requests a page makes besides its reads, measured, 0 or more.
 * A page of r requests of m papers (k = r·m) sends R with each of them, the
 * page's earlier reads again (m·c·r(r − 1)/2 in all), and R with each of its
 * o other requests, so a job of N papers costs about
 *   N·R/m + N·c·(r − 1)/2 + N·o·R/(r·m)
 * input tokens, least at r* = √(2·o·R / (m·c)), which is k* = √(2·m·o·R / c)
 * kept to whole requests. The cost bound is m·max(1, round(r*)): at least
 * what one request reads, since with no other requests (o = 0) a page read
 * in one request sends no read twice, and a larger page only adds requests
 * that do. Every term is the job's own: R and c when the page is planned, m
 * over its reads so far, o over its ended pages; before it has measured
 * them, m and o take the priors below.
 *
 * Why this rule. A scripted 212-paper job, with reads of about 12k tokens
 * each, compared it with three others: (a) the fit bound alone, (b) the cost
 * bound round(k*) with o at least 1 and m the mean of all reads (a read of a
 * whole page counting as at least the prior), and (c) the cost bound with o
 * measured and pages of at least that m. Estimated input tokens in all
 * (requests, peak prompt):
 *
 *   rule  1M window, ≤8 a request   1M, 3 a request        128k, ≤8           128k, 3
 *   (a)   12.45M (29, 808k)         35.94M (74, 856k)      1.62M (49, 56k)    3.96M (86, 81k)
 *   (b)    9.68M (41, 580k)         21.07M (84, 560k)      1.96M (76, 56k)    3.40M (96, 81k)
 *   (c)   16.34M (73, 448k)         16.34M (73, 448k)      2.15M (73, 56k)    2.15M (73, 56k)
 *   this   6.38M (30, 448k)         16.37M (73, 448k)      1.63M (50, 56k)    2.18M (73, 56k)
 *
 * Each of the others is far worse somewhere: pages read over many requests
 * send their reads again and again (a), and pages smaller than what the
 * model reads at once send R more often (b, c). This rule had the least
 * input, or within 1.5% of it, in every case, at 30 to 73 requests.
 *
 * While a page is open, a paper read gets at most the page's planned cost
 * per paper, min(c, ⌊(B − P) / (K + 1)⌋): c when the room holds the page and
 * a paper of slack, else what the page's papers and that slack share. A
 * small page thus does not hand each paper the whole room, which would raise
 * c and shrink the next page. On a page that reads its papers' text, a read
 * gets at least what a paper's record returns (`PAPER_RECORD_PRIOR_TOKENS`):
 * a c measured low, from papers without text, say, must still leave a read
 * something to read. Only the share has that floor, never c: a job of
 * changes is priced at what its calls measurably cost, however little.
 *
 * A page's end replaces the reads of its papers with per-paper digests
 * (`context/paperDigests.ts`). The job's results and its reading share the
 * room a restarted prompt leaves (B − base): each of the job's N papers gets
 * a digest of d = min(max(c, r), ⌊(B − base) / 2N⌋) tokens, r what a paper's
 * record returns, so every paper's results together fill at most half of it
 * and every page keeps the other half to read in. The half is a hard bound;
 * r only keeps a c measured low from cutting a digest to nothing.
