/**
 * The Task progress store: one record per conversation of what the current
 * task is doing — its run state, the per-paper ledger, the scope it covers,
 * and the steps an action, Codex or the run's outcomes hold — and of the
 * questions and actions before it, each with its own words, steps and
 * ending (`questions`).
 *
 * The store owns no DOM. Writers are the turn owners (the agent engine, the
 * Codex callbacks, the request lifecycle); readers are the Task progress
 * views, which subscribe and repaint on their own schedule. Every writer is
 * idempotent, so a replayed or duplicated event changes nothing.
 *
 * At most `TASK_PROGRESS_MAX_CONVERSATIONS` idle conversations are kept,
 * least recently written first out. A conversation with a live run neither
 * counts against that limit nor is evicted, so live runs can never crowd out
 * the conversations being opened beside them.
