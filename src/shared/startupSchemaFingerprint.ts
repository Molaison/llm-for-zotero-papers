/**
 * Startup schema passes and the Zotero transaction queue.
 *
 * Each conversation store re-issues its whole schema on every launch (tables,
 * columns, indexes, marker reads, self-heal passes, fence triggers).  Inside
 * `Zotero.DB.executeTransaction` that was harmful: the passes share Zotero's
 * single storage thread with its own library load, so each awaited statement
 * queues behind Zotero's work and the transaction stayed open for minutes.
 * Everything else in Zotero that calls `executeTransaction` (sync, repository
 * updates, bundled-file updates) waits on an open transaction and times out
 * after 30 s.  A statement issued outside a transaction does not block those
 * callers.
 *
 * So the transaction is only needed while the store's schema is not yet
 * current: a first run, an upgrade that adds a migration or a fence version, or
 * a database whose markers are missing.  Once the transactional pass commits it
 * records a fingerprint of what it applied, in the same database as the schema
 * it describes (never a pref: prefs are per profile and the database can be
 * swapped underneath them).  A later launch that finds the same fingerprint and
 * every declared migration marker runs the unchanged, idempotent pass without
 * the transaction.
